### The story
In grade 12, I created a collection of webgames coded in javascript and html.\
While they were somwhat messy, it was a fantastic introduction to the logic behind coding\
My goal was not only to create functional programs, but to also create a game that was fun and engaging.\
As a personal project, I am hoping to revisit and refurbish these programs.
