# Taylor's Projects 
### Welcome!

The purpose of this repository is mainly allow job recruiters to view my past projects and any nifty things I've created.\
These projects range in quality from small webgames made during my highschool free time, to legitimate code for university projects.\
This repository is constantly growing as I work to retrieve old projects, and work on new ones.\
\
Thanks for viewing!\
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at minnietj@hotmail.com\
Have a wonderful day!


## Index:
#### 1. Line Following Robot
Code for my autonomous line following robot. Includes a both simple proportional and full PID variations.\
With limited development and debugging time, it was found that the proportional variation was more than sufflicient and performed better tha the more complicated PID. 
#### 2. Fish and Lazer pug Games
These are two related games created during high school. Coded in Javascript, they are simple arcade style games aimed to be intuitive and fun.\
I'm hoping to refurbish and revamp these games as a self-development project in the near future, as well as hopefully make them available for play.
#### 3. C Projects
A small collection of Programs in C for various (mostly learning) purposes\
Contains a money-tracking Betting game, a bitmap image manipulator, and a Seven Segment Display Controller
#### 3. Supermileage CAN BUS PCB
A description and project files for the custom PCB designed for UBC's Supermileage design team.\
The purpose of this projects was to enable communications between elements such as healights and steering wheel driver inputs through the CAN BUS LAN communiaction protocol.
This project uses a Texas Instruments MSP430 2553 microcontroller, MCP2515 CAN controller IC, and a CAN tranceiver.
