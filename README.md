# Line-Following-Robot
Hello!
This is a repository for the code written to control a line following robot.
The course consisted of a black electrical tape line on a white plastic board. The course included intersections, blind 90' turns, missing sections, and slow curves.
The robot consisted of a hand soldered sensor board, H-bridge circuit, and ATmega microcontroller mounted on a wooden chassis. The QRD 1114 sensors were housed in a 3D printed sensor bracket held 0.75 cm away from the ground.
This project was created in the fall of 2018 for my Integrated engineering design course. The project was a success! Sharkie the shark-themed robot was able to follow the test course flawlessly.
Please feel free to ask me any questions about this project at minnietj@hotmail.com
Thanks!
