# Taylor's Projects 
### Welcome!

This respository acts as a portfolio for my past projects in Computer Software and Hardware design.\
These projects range from small webgames made in my highschool free time, to code for university projects.\
This repository is constantly growing as I work to retrieve old projects, and work on new ones.\
\
Thanks for viewing!\

## Index:
#### 1. Line Following Robot
Code for my autonomous line following robot. Includes a both simple proportional and full PID variations.\
With limited development and debugging time, it was found that the proportional variation was more than sufflicient and performed better tha the more involved PID. 
#### 2. Fish and Lazer pug Games
These are two related games created during high school. Coded in Javascript, they are simple arcade style games aimed to be intuitive and fun.\
I'm hoping to refurbish and revamp these games as a self-development project in the near future, as well as hopefully make them available for play.
#### 3. C Projects
A small collection of Programs in C for various (mostly learning) purposes\
Contains a money-tracking Betting game, a bitmap image manipulator, and a Seven Segment Display Controller
#### 3. Supermileage CAN BUS PCB
A description and project files for the custom PCB designed for UBC's Supermileage design team.\
The purpose of this project was to enable communications between different nodes in the vehicle (ex. headlights, throttle inputs) through the CAN BUS LAN communiaction protocol.
This project uses a Texas Instruments MSP430 2553 microcontroller, MCP2515 CAN controller, and a CAN tranceiver.
#### More to come!
