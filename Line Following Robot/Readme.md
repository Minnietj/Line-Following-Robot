### Hello Dear Visitor,

This is a collection of my code used to control my autonomous line following robot.\
The course consisted of a black electrical tape line on a white plastic board; it included 
intersections, blind 90' turns, missing sections, and slow curves. \
The robot consisted of a hand soldered sensor board, H-bridge circuit, and ATmega microcontroller mounted on a custom fabricated chassis.\
The QRD 1114 sensors were housed in a 3D printed sensor bracket held 0.75 cm away from the ground.\
This project was created in the fall of 2018 for my Integrated engineering design course.\
The project was a success! Sharkie the shark-themed robot was able to follow the test course flawlessly.\
Please feel free to ask me any questions about this project at minnietj@hotmail.com\
Thanks!\
