# C Projects

### Betting Game
A small game where money is bet and counted.\
This program begins by asking the user how much money they have in their wallet. This money will be tracked for the rest of the game.\
The game then asks how much money the user would like to bet, and simulates the rolling of two die.
In case of a win, the user wins their bet.\
In case of a loss, the user loses it.\
Should the user run out of money, the game will end.
### Image Manipulator
A program to manipulate bitmap image colour, brightness, and more.\
This program makes extensive use of arrays and file access.\
Each pixel of the image is stored in the form of three arrays, one each for the red, blue, and green values of the pixel's colour.\
This program can be used to convert the image to grayscale, apply a colour filter, or create the image's negative.\
### Pascals Triangle
This program will print a pascal's triangle of a size prompted by the user.
This program makes entensive use of loops.
### Seven Segment Display Counter
This program was created to work with a custom DAC with a row of 4 seven segment displays.\
It makes use of a lookup table to display numbers. The user inputs the start and stop values, and the program will instruct the DAC to count up from the start value and stop at the stop value.\
The DAC also has a number of switches. Shouls the "RUN" switch be flipped, the program will stop counting, until the switch is flipped back.\
Should the "RESET" switch be flipped, the program will restart and prompt the user to input a stop and start value once more.
### Seven Segment Display Scroller
This program makes use of the same DAC as described above to scroll text characters across the seven segment displays.\
It makes use of a lookup table to correctly display the lettering. The lookup table works by assigning each letter a binary number for the DAC to read. Each binary digit represents an ON or OFF state for each segment on a display.\
The user is also able to control the speed of the scrolling with a switch on the DAC hardware.
### Snake Game
This is an unfinished program I am working on to demonstrate by C++ coding abilities.\
Unfortunately it appears that much of my work in C from previous year was not saved, and as a result I am not able to show you here.\
I am unable to finsih this project at the moment due to Midterm season in classes, but I hope to return to it as soon as I can!\
In the meantime, I thought there would be no harm in uploading it.
### Thanks!
